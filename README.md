# What is Go?

Go, more easily searchable as Golang, is a programming language written by Google. They had millions of lines of code that were being constantly updated. The time it took to use their code to make actual programs was just to high. So, they sought to make a new programming language, one that in their words would "eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development"

You're probably asking yourself "Why should I learn Go?" The entire purpose of Go was to make it faster and easier for developers to develop, while still being as powerful as possible. On the coding speed side, it has a garbage collector, which means you don't have to waste time dealing with garbage yourself. On the power side, it has multi-core capabilities and built-in concurrency support.

In short, Go was meant to be as easy to develop in as languages like python, while being as powerful and fast as langauges like C. It's not quite as easy as Python, and it's not quite as fast as C. It is, however, a very good compromise.
